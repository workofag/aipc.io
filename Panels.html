                Power Control Center is used for distribution and control of various power source used in industry. This is the first point where power comes from Transformer and DG. Normally Power Control Center is installed near power source hence needs to be adequately designed with high tolerance for Bus bar, support, cooling, switchgear etc. Our design ensure sufficient space for cable termination. By default, we incorporate, various protections viz short circuit, overload, earth fault, under voltage etc, to ensure smooth functioning and protection for source and equipment.

                APFC Panels are mainly used for the improvement of Power Factor. Power Factor can be explained as ratio between true power and actual power flowing through the circuit. 
                To achieve unity power factor AUTOMATIC POWER FACTOR CONTROL PANEL is used.
                Automatic Power Factor Controller, consists of capacitor banks which are added to the circuit as and when required.
                We are offering a wide range of APFC Panels having capability of saving maximum power and energy. Our Highly efficient APFC Panels save energy by accurately monitoring the reactive power in power systems. Our APFC panels are Fabricated using quality material and consists capacitors with series reactors that helps in minimizing the harmonic current.

                Auto Main Failure Panels, also known as AMF panels, are used to automatically changeover from mains electricity supply to stand-by generator or gen set on failure of the mains supply. When the mains supply is restored, the system automatically changes back and stops the gen set. The stand-by generator will be eventually shut down after a short cooling down period.

                we design, engineer and manufacture Automatic as well as Manual Changeover Panels for Mains and standby generator power supply applications as well as for applications having dual power supply. These panels use circuit breakers or motorized changeover switches to power your infrastructure during a mains failure
