                LPC power controller is a solid state power controller used for electric heating applications. LPC provides output power that is proportional to the input command signal from temperature controller. This controller operates on phase angle fired mode.            </div>
                Proportional voltage output from LPC controller helps to produce a closely controlled heater temperature which saves energy, increases heating life by holding heater element at a nearly constant temperature.
                This controller operating voltage is 415 VAC, three phase +N.
